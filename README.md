  --> basics of TypeScript
        -Basic TypeScript Syntax: Understand the basic syntax of TypeScript, 
         such as variables, data types, functions, and control flow constructs 
         (if statements, loops, etc.).

        -Interfaces and Types: Learn about interfaces and types in TypeScript, which are used to define the shape of objects, including properties and methods.

        -Classes: Understand how classes work in TypeScript, including inheritance, access modifiers (public, private, protected), and constructors.

        -Modules: Learn how to organize your code using modules in 
         TypeScript. Modules help in keeping your code modular and 
         maintainable.

        -Arrow Functions: Understand the concept of arrow functions in 
         TypeScript, which provide a concise syntax for writing functions.

        -Generics: Learn about generics in TypeScript, which allow you to 
         write reusable code that works with a variety of data types.

        -Type Inference: Understand how type inference works in TypeScript, -        which allows the compiler to automatically determine the types of 
         variables based on their usage.

        -Decorators: Familiarize yourself with decorators in TypeScript, 
         which are used for adding metadata or modifying the behavior of 
         classes, methods, or properties.

        -Advanced Types: Explore advanced types such as union types, 
         intersection types, conditional types, and mapped types in 
         TypeScript.

        -TypeScript Compiler (tsc): Learn how to use the TypeScript compiler 
         (tsc) to compile TypeScript code into JavaScript.

         -TypeScript Tooling: Familiarize yourself with TypeScript tooling, 
          including IDEs (such as Visual Studio Code) and TypeScript-related 
          npm packages.

         -ES6+ Features: Understand modern JavaScript features (ES6 and 
          beyond) supported by TypeScript, such as arrow functions, template 
          literals, destructuring, spread/rest operators, and more.
